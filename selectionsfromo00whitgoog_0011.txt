vi PREFACE.

origin of a word, when known, is stated at the com
mencement of the article treating of it, if connected
with another Latin, or Greek, word; at the end os
it, if derived from any other source. Further still,
the primary or etymological meaning is always
given, within inverted commas, in Roman type,
and so much also of each word's history as is
needful to bring down its chain of meanings to
the especial force, or forces, attaching to it in
the particular “ Text.'’

Moreover, as an acquaintance with the principles
os Gnnwunn, as well as with Ervuonoor, is
necessary to the understanding of a language, such
points of construction as seem to require elucida-
tion are concisely explained under the proper
articles, ora reference is simply made to that rule
in the Public Schools Latin Prainer, or in Parry’s
Elementary Greek Grammar, which meets the
particular difficulty. lt occasionally happens, how-
ever, that more information is needed than can he
gathered from the above-named works. When
such is the case, whatever is requisite is supplie
in substance, from Jelf’s Greek Grammar, Wine
Grammar of New Testament Greek, or the [r
Grammars of Zumpt and Madvig.

Lounou : May, 1875.
